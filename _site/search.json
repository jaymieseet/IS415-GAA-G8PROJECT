    "text": "Our project focuses on analyzing seismic data sourced from the Earthquake Repository managed by BMKG (an Indonesian non-departmental government agency). This repository contains earthquake events that occurred in Indonesia from 1 November 2008 to 15 December 2023.\nOur analysis involves performing spatio-temporal analysis to identify emerging hotspots for earthquakes. We aim to not only pinpoint regions experiencing frequent seismic activity but also to identify patterns of smaller earthquakes leading to the occurrence of larger seismic events. This aids in understanding the intricate relationship between earthquake occurrences and discovering underlying spatial trends with ease.\nThrough this application, users can access geospatial analysis outcomes on Indonesia’s seismic data without the need for programming skills.\n\n\n\nGiven Indonesia’s geographical location along the Pacific Ring of Fire, the country experiences frequent and intense earthquakes. It lies in the intersections with three major tectonic plates: the Indo-Australian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Pacific Plate. The constant interaction of these plates, along with the interaction with several other minor plates such as the Philippine Sea plate and the Caroline plate, amplifies the geological complexity of the region. This makes it crucial to examine the geospatial data related to seismic activity. We aim to also use this data to conduct further research to understand how geological features might relate to these events.\n\nEarthquakes in Indonesia often strike in densely populated areas, causing many people to lose their homes, livelihoods and property. By leveraging spatial analysis techniques, we can provide insights that can inform proactive disaster management strategies, urban planning decisions and infrastructure resilience in Indonesia. Keeping well-informed is a good way to minimise negative impacts in the event of a seismic activity. \nFurthermore, earthquakes are often met with foreshocks and aftershocks of smaller magnitudes, which can be analysed to understand the spatial patterns and predict coming shocks. This includes identifying areas prone to high levels of seismic activity and implementing building codes and infrastructure improvements to reduce the impact of earthquakes on communities.\nPerforming such spatial analysis necessitates expertise in execution, including proficiency in data wrangling and cleaning to ensure accuracy. However, many users lack coding skills or familiarity with R packages, posing a challenge to understanding and conducting these analyses effectively. Consequently, developing an interactive application offers an accessible solution. Users can comprehend analysis findings and adjust parameters to suit their objectives without the lengthy execution processes.\n\n\n\n\nConducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides users with contextual insights into the regions where frequent seismic activities occur.\nConduct spatial autocorrelation analysis\n\nGlobal and Local Moran’s I statistical test to examine the degree of similarity between observations in a dataset based on their spatial proximity\nIdentify specific areas of significant spatial clustering (hotspots and cold spots)\n\nSpatio-temporal analysis to identify emerging hotspots\n\n\n\n\nThis Earthquake dataset is taken from the Earthquake Repository managed by BMKG (an Indonesian non-departmental government agency).  It contains earthquake event data from 1 Nov 2008 to 15 Dec 2023, but may not be accurate for some of the last earthquake events recorded. \n\nIndonesia’s Subnational Administrative Boundaries extracted from HDX."
